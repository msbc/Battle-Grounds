The man continues to speak. You listen carefully and write down what you hear as you go.

Basics:

Each class has specific stats and specialties. Some prefer the offensive while others thrive under the defensive. Some just want to be the most annoying [Not PG!!!] imaginable.
Your goal? Slay your opponent! The last one standing is the victor! Use your selection of combat options wisely as they could mean life or death.
The most advanced and skilled fighters are ones who can accurately read a battle and capitalize on anything they can!

Moves:

You have 3 total options: An attack, a block, and a spell/status effect of sorts.
Attacks will harm the opponent, bringing you closer to victory with each successful blow.
However, attacks can be mitigated through the power of the block! Blocking will temporarily grant you an extra line of defense for that move, any damage that goes over a shield will result in HP lost.
And last but certainly not least the status move. This move lets you temporarily boost or reduce stats of either yourself or the opponent. Varying based on the champion you select.

There is a triangle method to what move should be used when. Attacks are best used against statuses, statuses against blocks, and blocks against attacks.
Select the right one and celebrate an advantage! If not, keep fighting and learn!

When you select a move, type in the move name as shown in the stat block and it 'should' go through as valid!
If not, try something similar or double check your spelling.

Extra:

Stats of you and your opponent will be put on display at the start of a fight and after each turn plays out. These show you some important things.
The two biggest ones are the HP and move stats. HP is your health, obviously. If it wasn't obvious enough already, keep it above 0 if you value your life.
Move stats on the other hand are a different beast. Next to the move names will be the stats that each move CURRENTLY has. These are inside the ()'s.
After each turn plays out, the stats will be updated automatically. So no need to track it manually.

"Well. I think that is about everything you need to know. Good luck, and may the strong survive."
